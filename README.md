# DGTL Doughnut visualisations
This github repository contains the scripts and datafiles used for the interactive visualisations of the DGTLdoughnut website (add link), which will give you insights into DGTL festival’s systems and their related footprint, and will provide you with a deeper understanding on how festivals can and are taking measures to become more sustainable and climate neutral places.

We strongly believe that it's essential to share knowledge on and enhance the replicability of this important topic, which is why we elaborated on the specifics of our methodology here (add link PDF). This github repository contains the visuals that connect this method, the content of this repository is open source. It contains five folders that are directly used at the webstie: the Doughnut, Energy, Materials, Mobility and Water, and one folder with older versions of visualisation. Below a more in depth explanation of each visual is given.
